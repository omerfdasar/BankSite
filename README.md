# BankSite

Website: https://omerfdasar.github.io/BankSite/

I used different array methods and DOM elements to create this site.

Bankist is a fabricated and basic online banking application that allows the user to:

Log in with a username and password
View and sort their monetary movements
Transfer money to another account in the crediantials
Request a loan from the bank
Delete their account


Log in credentials:
